Frapuu is a real Hesse and wraps around a so called Bembel, a hessian earthenware jug for serving apple cider. If it’s not sitting in a cider pub eating marinaded Handkäse, you’ll find the Frapuu on the Sachenhäuser Berg, writing Poems with a dreamy look on the most beautiful city in the rhine main area: Frankfurt.

Our Frapuu is cultivated and cosmopolitan and knows how to party, as is Frankfurt. We have to assume that Frapuu is a direct descendant of Goethe himself.
